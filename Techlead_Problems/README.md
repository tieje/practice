I've decided to use what I've paid for first.
My current process will be:
1. Create a new python file. The title will simply be a copy and paste of the problem title.
2. Work on the problem for about half an hour.
3. Look at the solution and try to explain it to an empty chair.
4. Move the file to the Solution_Archive. I don't think I'll ever look at these solutions again, but I may as well keep them just in case.

The guideline is that learning is what's really important. I will NOT be going back to old solutions unless I've done them before.
