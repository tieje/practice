# [LeetCode Problems](https://leetcode.com/)

I will not be writing my code for leetcode problems here.
I'll be writing it in my notebook first and then on the website itself.

## Conclusion For Now

I'm not allowed to see the solution without a premium subscription.

Personally, I don't think it's worth it to buy the leetcode subscription because I won't have access to it later if I need it. We'll see about my dedication through studying Techlead problems.

## 5/5/2022

Buenos dias, I have returned.
I have decided to study algorithm questions and leetcode problems.
- skip
    - any problem that does not have a solution
    - hard problems (for now)

I'm going to keep all the solutions on the leetcode application for now.
Though I will use a white and pen for studying.
I'm not sure if I should go by the curated list for learning or the top interview questions.
I would like to use the curated list because it's mostly for people who are beginners.
But most of the problems are for premium users. Sheesh.
