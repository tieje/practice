# Practice
I want to spend an hour practicing coding problems every day.

# Practice Strategy

1. Attempt the problem.
    - Read and understand the problem.
    - Brainstorm solutions.
    - Manually test solution with simple and edge cases.
    - Translate solutions to code.
    - If you do not know how to solve the problem, look at the real solution tomorrow and try to understand it.
2. Attempt the problem again when you cycle back through questions.

# Things I have learned

1. How to let go of an idea if I run out of time.
2. The Techlead's solutions are not always good. I might need to try leetcode instead.
